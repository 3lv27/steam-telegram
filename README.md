# Steam Player's notifications app

It consists of a simple app which, depending on your list of Steam friends, check their status to find out if they are 
online playing any game. 

In this case, the program sends a message to a specified Telegram group to notify that your friend is currently online.

The app acts as an intermediary to consult information from the Steam API and send it through the Telegram API.
